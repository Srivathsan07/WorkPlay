                <p class="font-size-18">Working part time within the AFL's Data and Analytics team has been an extremely
                  rewarding and enjoyable experience. As a workplace, the AFL has built a strong culture centered around
                  its genuine care for its people. The flexibility afforded to my work schedule makes juggling the
                  commitments of AFLW much more manageable, as I'm supported and encouraged to work from where it suits
                  best, have adjustable finishing hours, and shuffle my days if required. As an employer, the AFL has a
                  unique understanding of the pressures of AFLW and the intensity of my training requirements, so there
                  is no added stress of needing to legitimize or justify the hours and energy which I need to direct
                  towards my football. It is awesome to have so many people within the organization engaged and invested
                  in how the team and I are going.</p>
